## Game Pitch

# Executive Summary
"Escape to Freedom" is a thrilling adventure game where players assume the role of Fony Tontana, a 30-year-old Cuban refugee escaping Fidel Castro's dictatorship. In this quest, players navigate the perilous waters around Cuba, brave the challenging conditions of the Gulf of Mexico, and strategically reach the coastal waters of the U.S.A. on a boat. Evading wildlife, security forces, and harsh weather, players must survive and ultimately reach the coveted destination of Miami, Florida, for a chance at a better life. 

# Overview
Escape from the beautiful island of Cuba to avoid the dictatorship of Fidel Castro. You are a Cuban refugee named Fony Tontana, 30 years old trying to reach Miami Florida in hopes of a better life.

# The Quest
You must travel the ocean on Fony's boat, avoiding wildlife, and security and surviving against the rugged weather. Increase your score by staying alive. Reach the final coast of Miami, Florida to complete the game. The levels are broken into three parts, the first is leaving the waters of Cuba where dunes, sharks, coral, and the Cuban army will try to stop you, the second is the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico where giant squids, water vortexes, tornados and sharks will try to destroy you, and the third and final level is the coastal waters of the U.S.A where the U.S coast guard, sharks, dunes and the elusive Florida Man will try to stop you from entering 'murica.

# Main Character
The main character is a middle-aged Cuban man named Fony Tontana, 30 years of age, with short dark brown hair and 5"7. His only power is picking up floating bags filled with a white powdered substance floating in the waters. He enters "The Limit" mode where he brings out his special little M16A1 friend he brought from Cuba which fires 5.56Ã—45mm NATO. The game is a third-person view side scroller.
